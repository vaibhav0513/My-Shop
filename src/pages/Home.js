        A smartphone (or simply a phone) is a portable computer device that
        combines mobile telephone functions and personal computing functions
        into one unit. They are distinguished from older-design feature phones
        by their more advanced hardware capabilities and extensive mobile
        operating systems, which facilitate wider software, access to the
        internet (including web browsing over mobile broadband), and multimedia
        functionality (including music, video, cameras, and gaming), alongside
        core phone functions such as voice calls and text messaging. Smartphones
        typically contain a number of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) integrated
        circuit (IC) chips, include various sensors that can be leveraged by
        pre-installed and third-party software (such as a magnetometer, a
        proximity sensor, a barometer, a gyroscope, an accelerometer, and more),
        and support wireless communication protocols (such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi,
        or satellite navigation).
